# ergo-ml

Repository consisting of machine learning approaches for automated ergonomic assessment of hand-intensive manufacturing. This project leverages preprocessed force and motion data to analyze, predict, and visualize ergonomic scores, supporting research and development in ergonomic risk assessment.

## Overview

The ergo-ml repository is organized into three main parts:
- **Annotation:** Methods to annotate ergonomic scores from the raw or preprocessed data.
- **Prediction:** Machine learning models and associated scripts for predicting ergonomic scores.
- **Visualization:** Tools and notebooks to visualize both the data and the results of the analysis.

In addition, the repository includes notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing to better understand the data characteristics and validate assumptions.
